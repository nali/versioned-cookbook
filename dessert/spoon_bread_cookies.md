1 1/2 dl sugar
2 teaspoon vanilla sugar
4 1/2 general purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda

## filling

### Method

Preheat butter into a stell kettle. Let the butter melt and boil briefly. Stir.
Boil the molten butter on modest heat for ten to fifteen minutes. Stir sporadically.
The butter may not burn, so keep a close eye on its color.

When the butter starts changing colour, take the kettle off the stove.

Measure the sugar onto the molten butter. Stir. Let the mixture cool and blend
the flour and baking soda. Mix the dry ingredients through a sieve into the butter-sugar
mixture.

Take the dough into a teaspoon and pad it into the spoon firmly. Remove the dough from
the teaspoon and lay them onto a baking sheet on a oven tray with approx one centimeter
spacing.

Bake in the upper part of an oven in 175 degrees C for 10-12 min.

Spread rapsberry jelly onto the flat side of a cookie and press the cookies against one another.

If you wish, roll the ready made cookies with filling in fine white sugar.
