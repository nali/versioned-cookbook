- 16 dl wheat flour
- 150 g butter

Filling:

1. Mix yeast into warm milk. Add eggs, sugar, spices and a few deciliters of flour. Mix into a homogenous mixture.
2. Add the rest of the flour little by little while stirring with your hands. (Keep one hand clean in case the telephone rings) until the dough no longer sticks to the sides of the dough bowl.
3. Let the dough double in size under a cloth in a place with no draft.
4. Use a rolling pin to spread the dough into two 60-by-30 cm squares.
5. Spread the soft butter on the thin dough plates, sprinkle the sugar and cinnamon on top.
6. Roll the dough into a roll, leave the seam facing down. Cut the rolls with a sharp knife into triangular shapes.
7. Press the top of each triangle to create nice shapes.
8. Let the dough rise once more under a cloth in a place with no draft.
9. Spread some egg on top of the pastries with a brush, sprinkle some nib sugar for decoration.
