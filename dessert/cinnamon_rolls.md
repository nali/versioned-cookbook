# Cinnamon rolls (fin. Korvapuusti)

## Ingredients

###Dough:
- 50 g of fresh yeast
- 5 dl milk
- 2 eggs
- 2 dl of sugar
- 2 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp ground cardamom
- ca. 17 dl wheat flour
- 150 g butter

###Filling (roughly):
- 200g butter
- 1 dl sugar
- 4 tbsp cinnamon

###Decoration:
- 2 eggs, nib sugar

## Method

1. Pre-heat the oven to 225 degrees Celsius.
2. Mix yeast into warm milk. Add eggs, sugar, spices and a three deciliters of flour. Mix into a homogenous mixture.
3. Stir the mixture with your hands and add gradually some 10 dl of flour.
4. Add molten butter to the mix, continue mixing with your hand.
5. Keep adding flour little by little until the dough no longer sticks to the sides of the bowl. Be patient and add the flour in small amounts and take your time mixing the dough. Otherwise you will end up using too much flour.
6. Let the dough swell to twice its original size under a cloth in a place with no draft on top of the oven or somewhere else warm.
7. Use a rolling pin to spread the dough into a rectangle on a flour dusted tabletop. Thinner dough makes for more spins in the roll. The thinner the dough is, the more of the buttery-sugary-cinnomony goo you can spread on it.
8. Melt the butter a bit and mix it with the sugar and cinnamon into a paste. Spread the paste onto the dough.
9. Roll the dough up and leave the seam facing down.
10. Cut the roll into triangular shapes, make them smaller than you want, they will swell later on. Take these triangles onto a tray lined with baking paper with the tip facing up. Every other chunk of dough should have the seam on the top, every other one should be laying on the seam. Leave plenty of space for the pastries to swell in oven.
11. Press the top of each triangle down to make the swirl more pronounced an the pastry more flattened.
12. Let the pastries rise up again to roughly twice their original size
13. Spread some whipped egg onto the pastries and sprinkle some nib sugar on top for decoration. If you don't have nib sugar in your store, you might do an alternate icing instead, as illustrated.
14. Bake in the mid-level of the oven for 8-10 minutes until the rolls have a nice brownish color.
15. There are plenty of pastries that getter with time. This is not one of them so consume on the spot or freeze for later use.
