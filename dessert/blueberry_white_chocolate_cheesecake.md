# White chocolate-blueberry cheesecake

The original, slightly modified, recipe can be found at [http://taikakakut.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/valkosuklaa-mustikkajuustokakku.html], albeit in Finnish

## Ingredients

### Base
- 200 g oat biscuits (McVitie's Hobnobs but it really doesn't that much of a difference)
- 75-100 g butter

### Filling
- 3 dl whipping cream 
- approx. 400 g cream cheese (Philadelphia, ricotta...)
- 160g white chocolate 
- 6 gelatine foils
- 2-3 tbsp of lemon juice 

### Topping
- approx 300 g blueberries
- some water 
- 2 gelatine foils

### Raspberry sauce
- 400-500 g raspberries
- sugar 
- water

## Instructions

1. Crush the biscuits to a fine crumble. Mix enough butter to make a thick paste that can be spread on the  baking form. Refrigerate while you prepare the filling. 

2. Soak the gelatine foils in cold water while you prepare the rest of the filling. Whip the cream. Melt white chocolate in the microwave (be careful - it burns easily and becomes unusable so melt for 10-15 s, stir, and repeat until molten). Let the chocolate cool down and then add the cream cheese (I actually added the chocolate to the cream cheese, which made mixing the two evenly quite difficult, so I suggest really doing it in this order). Add the whipped cream to the mixture. Boil the lemon juice in the microwave and add the gelatine foils. Pour it in small amounts (and slowly, letting it cool down a bit before it touches the filling) and pour the filling to the baking form. Refrigerate for a couple of hours (or better, overnight). 

3. Wash the blueberries and top the cake with an even layer. Take the rest of the blueberries, add some boiling water and sugar (amount depends on the sweetness of the berries and your taste), mash the blueberries using a spoon and boil until the colour and taste have been transferred to the water. Separate the liquid from the blueberry skins using a sieve and let the liquid cool down. Take ~1-2 tbs of hot water, melt the gelatine foils and add to the “juice”. Add on top of the cake using a spoon and refrigerate until jellied. 

4. Prepare the raspberry sauce by boiling the raspberries with some sugar until thick.
