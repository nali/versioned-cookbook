# Dal

### Ingredients
For the lentils
* 1 cup of lentils (any type)
* 1 tsp garam masala
* 1 tsp of tomato paste or 1 fresh tomato 
* 1  stock cube

For the tarka
* 1 tbsp oil
* 1/4 tsp whole cumin
* 1 sprig curry leaves (10-12)
* 1 onion, finely sliced
* 2 cloves of garlic, chopped
* chillies, chopped (optional)


### Method

1. Wash lentils well. Place in pot with garam masala, tomato paste, stock cube and 2-3 cups of water. Bring to boil and then allow to simmer for 1 hour, skimming any froth off the top. At this point, you may want to puree the mixture using a stab mixer or blender, or, if you prefer your dal chunky, leave it as it is.

2. In a separate frypan, add the oil. Place on high heat, then add cumin seeds and curry leaves. When you can hear the cumin seeds popping, add in the onion. Wait until golden, then add chilli and garlic. Fry for a few minutes (being careful not to let the garlic burn), then add to the lentil stew.

3. Simmer the mixture for 10 minutes, then remove from heat and serve with hot roti.
